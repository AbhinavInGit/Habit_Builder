By completing daily micro-tasks, users gradually transform aspirations into automatic routines, supported by progress tracking and social accountability features.

- Chose habit-building as it impacts personal/professional growth
- Key challenges: Designing incremental tasks, tracking streaks visually
- Breakthrough: Gamified completion indicators (green-check system)
